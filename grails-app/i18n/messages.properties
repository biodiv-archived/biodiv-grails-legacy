#welcomeEmail
welcomeEmail.intro=Welcome to the WIKWIO Portal (Weed Identification and Knowledge in the Western Indian Ocean Portal)! You are now part of an exciting initiative designed to facilitate sharing of knowledge, participation and enable open access for all stakeholder in griculture in contributing information on Western Indian Ocean weed management in the cash and food crops for the benefit of science, agriculture and society. The portal offers the following modules:

welcomeEmail.observation=An aggregation of user submitted photos of individual sightings of a weed species with time and location information. Images of unidentified species can be identified harnessing the collaborative effort of our knowledgeable user community. You can submit observations, help in the identification or simply view submissions within your interest group, cropping systems or locality, using filters.

welcomeEmail.map=A collection of web-based interactive map layers with spatial information on Western Indian Ocean area. The fully-featured webGIS system allows you to overlay and visualize multiple layers; query and measure distances and areas; and zoom in and out, to look at areas of your interest. You can generate a URL for a map layers that you like, and embed it on your own web page.

welcomeEmail.checklist=A compilation of checklists of weed species belonging to a wide range of taxa and covering the different countries of the area of the project WIKWIO. You can search for a particular checklist by taxa, species name or location. Each checklist comes with it's own metadata, and terms of use, specified by the author and/or source. You can also download a copy of a checklist that interests you in more than one format.

welcomeEmail.species=An authenticated database of weed species pages with detailed information such as taxonomy, names, botanical description, biology, ecology and distribution, control methods, use, occurrence records and bibliography references. These pages also have links to further references and embedded images of the species from the wider web.

welcomeEmail.groups=Our Groups module connects you to join and interact with a fraternity of like-minded individuals comprising of experts and stakeholders to discuss topics of interest within the purview of the group subject. Groups can assemble observations, include species pages, maps and checklists. Each group also has pages and newsletters to allow members to collect, build and disseminate information.

welcomeEmail.documents=An aggregation of documents related to weed science and weed management in the tropics. Documents can be uploaded with information on taxonomic and spatial coverage, content description and author credits and shared under a Creative Commons licence. The document manager has been designed to facilitate sharing of metadata with global initiatives such as DataOne.

welcomeEmail.idao=Our identification IDAO module allows you to identify a weed from a portrait robot system. This process is used to identify a plant at any stage of growth or from an incomplete sample and requires no special competence in botany. Just describe the morphological characteristics of your sample from the different elements of the composite sketch by selecting the shapes of characters that you think match your sample.The application then calculates the probability for species from the base to fit with the description you made in the composite picture. At any time the illustrated species pages are available.

app.homepageDescription=WIKWIO aims to strengthen science and technology orientation to achieving food security by enhancing agricultural productivity in the Southern African region. Agricultural productivity is hampered by many factors, one important among them being weeds. Wikwio aims to build and leverage a Science & Technology network which will consolidate existing scientific knowledge and facilitate sharing of new scientific knowledge on weeds of food and cash crops of the region and effective management practices. Wikwio will deploy appropriate ICT solutions to build a multi-stakeholder community of researchers, extension services, civil society and farmers around an ICT knowledge base of weeds. The action aims at enhancing the capacities of researchers, reinforce the institutional capabilities of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) and Universities, empower extension services and improving their quality of service, through a participatory, technology facilitated platform.

namelist.taxonselector.info=Use this to navigate within the taxonomic hierarchy to a taxon of interest. Click the name on a taxon level to display the name and all its child taxa under the current list that it is held in. Select a name in one of the lists to view attributes for that name.

namelist.rawlist.info=The Raw list contains all names on IBP that have not been curated yet. ie. It has not been matched to a single name on the Catalogue of Life or a curator has not manually resolved it.

namelist.workinglist.info=The Working list contains names that have been curated, either via an automated match to the Catalogue of Life or manually by a curator. Curated names have been assigned a status, rank and all levels of its hierarchy must be populated (for an accepted name) or designated to accepted name (for synonyms).

namelist.cleanlist.info=The Working list contains taxon names which are confirmed to exist within India. It will serve as a dynamic list of taxa known to exist in the country. Clean Lists can only be populated by Species Curators of the respective taxa groups.

namelist.hierarchy.info=Displays the existing taxonomic hierarchy ranks as stored on the IBP taxonomic hierarchy. For names that find a match on Catalogue of life, the IBP hierarchy is the same as CoL. Such names are not editable and are greyed out.

namelist.attributes.info=Name attributes are properties that define the uniqueness and status of at name on IBP

namelist.name.info=Displays the canonical part of the taxon name. This is the part of the name that does not include the author name, year or any punctuation. eg:  Cuon alpinus

 namelist.commonnames.info=This tab displays the Common names on IBP for a scientific name. Use the drop down selector to mark the language of the name.

 namelist.query.info=Select a database from the dropdown and use to query the name in the database. Choosing a name from the result will populate appropriate fields with information.

 namelist.connections.info=Displays the number of species pages, observations, maps and documents currently linked with the name. Clicking the number will reveal the list pages.
