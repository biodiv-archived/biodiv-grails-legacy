#welcomeEmail
welcomeEmail.intro=Welcome to the India Biodiversity Portal (IBP)! You are now part of an exciting initiative designed to facilitate participation and enable open access for all citizens in contributing information on Indian biodiversity for the benefit of science and society. The portal offers the following modules: 
welcomeEmail.observation=An aggregation of user submitted photos of individual sightings of a species with time and location information. Unidentified images can be identified harnessing the collaborative effort of our knowledgeable user community. You can submit observations, help in the identification or simply view submissions within your interest group, habitat or locality, using filters. 
welcomeEmail.map=&nbsp;A collection of more than hundred web-based interactive map layers with spatial information on Indian biodiversity. Over 60 of these map layers are downloadable. The fully-featured webGIS system allows you to overlay and visualize multiple layers; query and measure distances and areas; and zoom in and out, to look at areas of your interest. You can generate a URL for an indiabiodiversity map layers that you like, and embed it on your own web page. 
welcomeEmail.checklist=A compilation of checklists of species belonging to a wide range of taxa and covering varied geographies of the Indian subcontinent. You can search for a particular checklist by taxa, species name or location. Each checklist comes with it's own metadata, and terms of use, specified by the author and/or source. You can also download a copy of a checklist that interests you in more than one format. 
welcomeEmail.species=An authenticated database of species pages with detailed information such as taxonomy, names, natural history, habitat and distribution, conservation and occurrence records. These pages also have links to further references and embedded images of the organism from the wider web. 
welcomeEmail.groups=Our Groups module connects you to join and interact with a fraternity of like-minded individuals comprising of experts and enthusiasts to discuss topics of interest within the purview of the group subject. Groups can assemble observations, include species pages, maps and checklists. Each group also has pages and newsletters to allow members to collect, build and disseminate information.
